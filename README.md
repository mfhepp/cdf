# cdf: Change to favorite directories 

It is often time-consuming to navigate your folder structure in a Bash terminal window, even with auto-complete.

`cdf` is a simple set of utility functions that can be added to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file (or `~/.zshrc` for `zsh`) and will provide two quite useful new commands, `addfav` ("add to favorites") and `cdf` ("`cd` to favorite"):

## Demo

```bash
cd ~/the/windy/road/to/my/many/papers
# Add the current directory as a shortcut named "papers"
addfav papers

cd ~/my/long/forgotten/photos
# Add the current directory as a shortcut named "pics"
addfav pics
```

```bash
# Go to a directory from wherever you are via its shortcut
cdf pics
# Your are now here: ~/my/long/forgotten/photos
cdf papers
# Your are now here: ~/the/windy/road/to/my/many/papers
```

## Features

- **Simple and lightweight:** `cdf` adds just two new commands:
  - `addfav` ("add to favorites") 
  - `cdf` ("`cd` to favorite")
- You can use any **short and memorable name** for your shortcuts, like `pet` or `thesis` (or even `p73`).
- Supports **auto-complete:** Just type the first few letters and hit the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. Now also for `zsh`.
- All **shortcuts can also be used in** a GUI tool like **Apple Finder,** because they are simple symbolic links. 

## Installation (UNIX/OSX only)

### Simple 

1. Download the tool from Github to your computer
  - **Option 1:** With `git clone`:
    ```bash
    mkdir some_directory
    cd some_directory
    git clone https://github.com/mfhepp/cdf.git
    cd cdf
    ```
  - **Option 2:** Download and extract ZIP from <https://github.com/mfhepp/cdf/zipball/main>
2. Open a terminal window in the respective directory.
3. Run the install script `install.sh`
    ```bash
    # Run script
    ./install.sh
    ```
    Normally, the install script should be executable as it stands. If not, run     
    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ```
4. Open a new terminal window for the changes to take effect.

### Manual installation

1. Create a directory in your home directory, e.g. `~/myshortcuts`, either in the OSX Finder or a terminal window with 
    ```bash
    mkdir ~/myshortcuts
    ```
    On OSX, it is better to put this somewhere under the `~/Documents` folder due to Apple's default permissions scheme.
2. Depending on your system, open either `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` with a text editor (or `~/.zshrc` for `zsh`). You may need to turn on the display of hidden files (starting with a dot) in the OSX Finder with <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd> (dot).
3. At the end of the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` (or `~/.zshrc`) file, insert the following lines:
    ```bash
    export CDFPATH=~/myshortcuts
    ```
    Replace `~/myshortcuts` with the absolute path of your chosen directory for the shortcuts (e.g. `~/Documents/myshortcuts`; note that `~/` is a shortcut for your user directory on Unix systems; you can also use the full path.). **Save the file, but keep it open.**
4. After these lines, insert the entire contents [from the `cdf.sh` file from this repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfhepp/cdf/main/cdf.sh). You can directly copy-and-paste it from the link. **Save and close the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`** (or `~/.zshrc`) file.
5. Open a new terminal window for the changes to take effect.

**Note:** Always backup your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` (or `~/.zshrc` for `zsh`) files prior to installing this tool. If not, please do not blame me if things go wrong. The install script tries to create backups automatically.

### Installation for `zsh`

This release should also work with `zsh`, not just Bash. Because this feature is experimental, the installer does not automatically add the code to your `.zshrc` file.

If you want to use `cdf` with `zsh`, simply apply the steps from the manual installation to your user's   `.zshrc` file, typically located at `~/.zshrc`.

## Usage

### Adding the current directory to the list of shortcuts with `addfav`

In any given directory, simply run the command

```bash
addfav NAME
```

with `NAME` being the name for the shortcut, like `project-a` or `phd`.

### Going to a directory via a given shortcut

In any given directory, simply run the command

```bash
cdf NAME
```

with `NAME` being the name for the shortcut, like `project-a` or `phd`.

### Listing available shortcuts

```bash
cdf --list
```

```bash
INFO: CDFPATH is set to /Users/foo/Documents/myshortcuts
Usage: cdf NAME

Existing directory shortcuts are:
 - photos
 - phd
 - summer-vacation
 - tax
```

You can also use `addfav --list` for the same purpose.

## Command-line arguments

```bash
CDF: Change to a directory via a shortcut from CDFPATH
Usage: cdf NAME

Example:
  cdf project-a: Change to the directory saved as "project-a"
  cdf --help:    Show help
  cdf --list:    List all available shortcuts

Hint: Use the TAB key for autocomplete with available shortcuts
```

```bash
ADDFAV: Adds the current directory as a shortcut to CDFPATH
Usage: addfav NAME

Example:
  addfav project-a: Add current directory as "project-a"
  addfav --help:    Show help
  addfav --list:    List all available shortcuts
```

## Technical details

The tool creates *symbolic links* pointing to the bookmarked paths in the chosen directory. When running `cdf`, we simply obtain the **physical path** with `realpath` (available on most modern systems) and the `cd` to that path, if it exists. Hence, **we end up in the *real physical location and not that of the symbolic link*.**

It is possible to use the `CDPATH` variable for similar purposes, but this has several downsides. One could also change the behavior of the original `cd` command, but I think it is bad practice to mess around with core OS components in an intransparent way; hence the usage of a new `cdf` command.

The script tries to prevent you from creating shortcuts to locations that are themselves symbolic links. 

## Warning: Be CAREFUL when DELETING symbolic links!

**IMPORTANT:** Read this if you want to delete shortcuts from the shortcuts folder! When unsure, **use** a GUI tool like the **OSX Finder for deleting symbolic links.**

This tool uses [symbolic links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link). While this an established part of any Unix-like environment, things can go terribly wrong **when deleting symbolic links**. In the **worst case, you can delete ALL CONTENTS of the target of a symbolic link** when you are **trying to delete the symbolic link.**

For more information, read [superuser.com: Does rm -rf follow symbolic links?](https://superuser.com/questions/382314/does-rm-rf-follow-symbolic-links).

In short: **A single slash will make a huge difference!!!**

```bash
# This will DELETE ALL FILES in the directory to which 
# the symbolic link `bar` points!!!
rm -r bar/
```

```bash
# This will only delete the symbolic link `bar` itself 
# and leave the files in the link target untouched.
rm -r bar
```

This warning is mostly relevant when you are trying to remove previously created symbolic links in the respective folder.

## Security considerations

The following aspects are not specific to this tool, but likely useful background information.

If properly used, symbolic links are a pretty safe mechanism, as the access rights required are determined by the target file or directory. On most Unix systems, the permissions of the symlink do not matter; that one of the linked target are relevant. On OSX, the symlink must be readable to `readlink`. See e.g. <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87200/change-permissions-for-a-symbolic-link>.

One security risk of symbolic links is that they may facilitate the discovery of high-value folders, same as they help you to access them.

Other security problems arise from symbolic links that cross boundaries of access privileges. Special **care should be taken when** creating symbolic links 
- **at locations where other users have write-access** (they could replace the link with a new one),
- **to locations where other users have write-access to** (they could change the contents or location you are actually working on or inject symbolic links that you will not identify as such.), and
- **to or at locations where users with root privileges may run executable files**.

A typically dangerous place are **/tmp** on Unix systems, and everything that is directly inside a user's directory on Apple OSX, i.e. not **below** the folders

```
Desktop/
Documents/
Downloads/
Library/
Movies/
Music/
Pictures/
```

This is because OSX, by default, grants at least read-access to all users on the given machine, via the `staff` usergroup.

If you were to use the `source` command to include the `cdf.sh` script within your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file (or `.zshrc` for `zsh`), you must make sure that the respective directory cannot be written to by other users. Otherwise, someone could inject arbitrary Bash commands into your environment. **This is why the install script instead *copies the contents of that script* to your Bash profile.**

## Credits and acknowledgments

This tool was initially inspired by the following article:

- <https://medium.com/@marko.luksa/linux-osx-shell-trick-create-bookmarks-so-you-can-cd-directly-into-the-dirs-you-use-regularly-64003051211f>

While the proposed approach works, it has a few limitations, namely that you end up in the symbolic link directory, not the physical `realpath` thereof, which can be confusing and intransparent.

ChatGPT 4 was a great buddy and time-saver, helping me through the many pitfalls of Bash as the grand, old lady of scripting languages.


## Similar projects

There are several other very popular tools for similar purposes, e.g.

- [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump)
  - learns recently used directories
  - requires Python
- [z.sh](https://github.com/rupa/z)
  - also tracks usage of directories
  - supports regular expressions and parts of target paths
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
  - feature-rich
  - written in Rust
  - requires installation of a binary

Main differences between `cdf` and most of these are as follows:

- `cdf` **uses explicitly set shortcuts instead of a usage-based list** of target paths. You will know where you'll end up and you can define catchy names for the core places in your file system.
- `cdf` **is very lightweight** (ca. 150 lines of Bash including comments), has **no dependencies** except for Bash, `realpath`, `ln`, and `find` (available on most modern operating systems), and does not require the installation of binaries. Hence, the risk of supply-chain attacks is minimal.
- `cdf` **provides just two functions:** (1) defining a short identifier for a directory and (2) a quick way to get to any previously defined location in your file-system.
- `cdf` **uses a simple folder with symbolic links** for managing the names and target locations of shortcuts.
- `cdf` **supports arbitrary names for any target path** that are **easy to remember.** You can use **very short names for your most popular directories;** like a simple form of [entropy coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_coding).
